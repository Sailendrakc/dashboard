      "I caught my cat doing something adorable today. My cat (shes usually aloof and proudly independent) slowly walked over, sat down on top of a warm hoodie I had just folded, looked straight at me, and started purring. Loudly. Then gently rested her paw on my leg.",

      "A long time ago I had a problem with my girl cat, Diva. I had to rush her to the veterinarian because she was having complications during birth. While the vet was working on her they asked me if I wanted to have her fixed while she was there and in surgery and I said yes because I figured it would be better than coming back and having her go through surgery again. She came out okay but none of the kittens survived.",

      "I had several incidents with my first dog. She was getting just a teensy bit lethargic and gaining weight. I put her on a diet but she gained more weight. The vet tech shrugged it off, suggesting that I was giving her too many treats without being aware of it.I pushed them to give her a blood test, and she had hypothyroidism.",

      "This dog Gina did not sit on my lap, did not bark, did not try to play with me.. she was simply ALWAYS there. Sitting beside me and letting me know that beside my shadow in the sunlight there would ALWAYS be hers. I can not begin to explain how much it means to you when another being, even if they cant speak stands beside you during the hardest moments of your life. Gina could be anywhere else in the house during those moments, anywhere else… but she would always choose to be right where she was needed.",
